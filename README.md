# Meeting Room Booking App


# To run
If you have not yet started the back-end, navigate to the back-end project and follow the readme.md
there.

Otherwise:
Open the terminal and make sure you are in the same level in the blackstone-frontend React app as package.json:
blackstone-frontend/

Create a file titled .env in this directory and copy/paste the following text, as is, without quotes: 
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3333

After you've done this, save the file before closing.

Then, open the command line on this same level and run the following command:
npm install
This will automatically install all of the node_modules files required to run application.

Then, open the command line on this same level and type:
npm start

You should see a message that reads at the bottom:
webpack compiled successfully

The website should automatically pop up on your web browser.
But if it does not, you can open a browser and navigate to the url: 
localhost:3000
